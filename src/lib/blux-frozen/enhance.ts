 * scrolled to the band with id `page-block-N`. Without that JS, `#N` matches
 * nothing. Rewrite to the real ids so native anchor navigation works.
 * (Digit-only fragments — real named anchors like `#site-icon-left` untouched.)
 *
 * `overrides` maps a Blux hash index to a different target id — measured
 * against the ORIGINAL site's runtime, which does not always resolve `#N` to
 * `page-block-N` (the-pointe's Contact Us `#11` scrolls to the page bottom /
 * footer, not to page-block-11).
